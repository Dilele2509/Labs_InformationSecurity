# Task 1: normal transaction with CRSF vulnerability

## 1.1: Login, Check balance
First we will launch the <span style="color:yellow">target.py</span> website. After launching we can see the website's interface:

We will change the path to access the login page and log in to the account of the user named Alice with <i>username</i> being <span style="color:red">alice</span> and <i>password</i> is <span style="color:red">alice</span>

<img width="726" alt="lab 3 1.1.3.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_1.1.3.png"><br>

Next, after successfully logging in, we continue to change the path to <span style="color:yellow">'/balance'</span> to check the account balance.

## 1.2: Doing the transaction
In this section, to transfer money to Bob's account, we will go to the transaction page via the link <span style="color:yellow">'/transfer'

<img width="726" alt="lab 3 1.2.1.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_1.2.1.png"><br>

After moving to the transaction page, enter the receiving account and the amount to transfer to perform the transaction.

After successful implementation, we return to check the balance again, then the balance will be deducted by the exact amount we just transferred:

## 1.3: Transfer money illegitimately
To perform a CSRF attack when user Alice accidentally downloads a file <span style="color:yellow">hidden_form.html</span>. We will launch the above website. As soon as the website is launched, user Alice will immediately lose 1000 and the attacker account will gain 1000:

<img width="726" alt="lab3_1.3.1.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_1.3.1.png"><br>

<img width="726" alt="lab3_1.3.2.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_1.3.2.png"><br>

Login into Attacker account, we can see this balance was increased
<img width="726" alt="lab3_1.3.3.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_1.3.3.png"><br>

<img width="726" alt="llab3_1.3.4.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_1.3.4.png"><br>

We can see that when launching the malicious html file, the input form to perform transactions of the official website was called to the fake website and at the same time it made transactions to an unwanted account, the account by Attacker. At that time, the attack through the CSRF vulnerability was performed.

# Task 2: CSRF Countermeasure implementation

## 2.1: Solution 1:
<span style="color:red"><b>Idea:</b></span> uses CSRF Token, this method will initialize a random value generated by the server and sent to the client . When the client sends a POST request, this token will be sent with the request and the server will check the token to confirm the request is valid.

<span style="color:red"><b>Step 1:</b></span> we will install the Flask-WTF library to use the CSRF token for the website <span style="color:yellow" Our >target.py</span><br>

<img width="726" alt="lab3_2.1.1.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_2.1.1.png"><br>

<span style="color:red"><b>Step 2:</b></span> Configure CSRF token in website: <br>

<img width="726" alt="lab3_2.1.2.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_2.1.2.png"><br>

We will proceed with the configuration to check the token before using the POST method<br>

<img width="726" alt="lab3_2.1.3.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_2.1.3.png"><br>

After the configuration is complete, run the website again and open the malicious website used to attack the above vulnerability. You will see that the attack has failed and has been blocked:<br>

## 2.2: Solution 2:
<span style="color:red"><b>Idea:</b></span> Check the HTTP Referer Header to prevent invalid requests from other sites.<br>

<span style="color:red"><b>Step 1:</b></span> Configure the website to check HTTP referer header:<br>

<img width="726" alt="lab3_2.2.2.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dilele2509/Labs_InformationSecurity/main/Images/lab3_2.2.2.png"><br>
<span style="color:red"><b>Step 2:</b></span> After setting it up, we will try to access transfer again from the attacker's site and we will see that the site has been blocked: <br>
